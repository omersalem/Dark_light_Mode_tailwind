# Portfolio Theming with Tailwind CSS

This project demonstrates how to create a simple portfolio page with a dark and light theme using Tailwind CSS.

## How it Works

The project uses HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript to create a webpage that can switch between a light and dark theme.

### `index.html`

This file provides the structure of the webpage.

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This declaration defines that the document is an HTML5 document.
- **`<html lang="en">`**: This is the root element of an HTML page. The `lang="en"` attribute specifies that the language of the page is English.
- **`<head>`**: This section contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title and links to stylesheets.
  - **`<meta charset="UTF-8" />`**: This specifies the character encoding for the HTML document, which is UTF-8.
  - **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`**: This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
  - **`<title>Portfolio Theming with Tailwind v4</title>`**: This sets the title of the page, which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
  - **`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`**: This links to an external stylesheet file named `style.css`.
  - **`<link rel="stylesheet" href="output.css" />`**: This links to the stylesheet generated by Tailwind CSS.
- **`<body>`**: This section contains the visible content of the HTML document.
  - **`class="bg-background text-text-primary transition-colors duration-300 ease-in-out"`**: These are Tailwind CSS classes that set the background color, text color, and a smooth transition effect when the theme changes.
  - **`<div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen p-8">`**: This is a container that centers its content both vertically and horizontally.
  - **`<h1>`**, **`<p>`**, **`<h2>`**: These are heading and paragraph tags used to display text. They are styled with Tailwind CSS classes for font size, weight, and color.
  - **`<div class="mt-8 p-8 bg-surface rounded-xl shadow-lg text-left">`**: This is a card-like element with a background color, rounded corners, and a shadow.
  - **`<button id="theme-toggle" ...>`**: This is the button that allows the user to toggle between the light and dark themes. It has an `id` of `theme-toggle` so that it can be targeted by the JavaScript code.
- **`<script src="index.js"></script>`**: This includes and runs the JavaScript code from the `index.js` file.

### `input.css`

This file defines the color palette for both the light and dark themes using CSS custom properties (variables). It also configures Tailwind CSS to recognize these themes.

- **`@import "tailwindcss";`**: This line imports the base styles, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS.
- **`@theme { ... }`**: This is a special block in Tailwind CSS v4 where you can define your design tokens. These tokens are then used to generate utility classes. For example, `--color-primary-blue` becomes `bg-primary-blue`, `text-primary-blue`, etc.
- **`@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));`**: This line tells Tailwind to generate a `dark` variant for all utility classes. These dark mode styles will be applied whenever the `.dark` class is present on an element or any of its ancestors.
- **`:root { ... }`**: This block defines the CSS custom properties for the light theme. These are the default colors for the webpage.
- **`.dark { ... }`**: This block defines the CSS custom properties for the dark theme. When the `.dark` class is applied to the `<html>` element, these colors will override the default light theme colors.

### `index.js`

This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the theme switching.

- **`const themeToggleBtn = document.getElementById("theme-toggle");`**: This line gets a reference to the theme toggle button from the HTML using its `id`.
- **`const setTheme = (theme) => { ... }`**: This is a function that takes a theme name (`"dark"` or `"light"`) as input and applies it to the webpage.
  - **`if (theme === "dark") { ... }`**: If the theme is "dark", it adds the `dark` class to the `<html>` element. This `dark` class is used by Tailwind CSS to apply the dark theme styles. It also saves the theme preference to the browser's local storage.
  - **`else { ... }`**: If the theme is not "dark", it removes the `dark` class from the `<html>` element and saves the "light" theme preference to local storage.
- **`const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme");`**: This line checks if a theme preference has been saved in the browser's local storage from a previous visit.
- **`const prefersDark = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches;`**: This line checks if the user has a system-wide preference for dark mode set in their operating system.
- **`if (savedTheme) { ... } else if (prefersDark) { ... } else { ... }`**: This block of code sets the initial theme when the page loads. It first checks for a saved theme, then for the user's system preference, and finally defaults to the light theme.
- **`themeToggleBtn.addEventListener("click", () => { ... });`**: This line adds a "click" event listener to the theme toggle button. When the button is clicked, the code inside the function is executed.
  - **`const isDark = document.documentElement.classList.contains("dark");`**: This checks if the `<html>` element currently has the `dark` class.
  - **`setTheme(isDark ? "light" : "dark");`**: This line calls the `setTheme` function to switch to the opposite theme. If the current theme is dark, it switches to light, and vice versa.
